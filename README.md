# approximate_models
This repository contains code of SEIR epidemic models that approximate simulation process of epidemics on networks.

Getting started. Go to the terminal in your project directory and do the following:
1. Create virtual environment
```
python -m venv .env
```
2. Activate virtual environment
Windows
```
.\.env\Scripts\activate
```
Mac OS
```
source .env/bin/activate
```
3. Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to start simulating epidemics! Go to **main.ipynb** for usage examples.
